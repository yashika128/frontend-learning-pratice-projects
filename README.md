## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frontend-learning-practice-projects.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd frontend-learning-practice-projects
```

3. Open any project folder and launch the HTML file in your browser, or use a local server:
```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js live-server (if installed)
npx live-server

# Using VS Code Live Server extension (recommended)
```

## 📖 How to Use

Each project folder contains:
- `index.html` - The main HTML file
- `style.css` - Stylesheet for the project
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality (where applicable)
- `README.md` - Project-specific documentation (some projects)

Simply open any `index.html` file in your browser to see the project in action!
